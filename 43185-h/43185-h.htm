<p><i>The character of Coriolanus Wellington, to carry out successfully the
idea of the author, should be played with an extreme degree of solemnity,
so as to appear ludicrous. His action should be of the lofty and
dignified order, but greatly overdrawn, and he should be decidedly
mechanical in his movements and gestures.</i></p>

<p class="hangingstage"><b>Enter</b> <i><span class="smcap">Dollerclutch</span>, D. R. 4 E., with lawyer&rsquo;s bag. He
empties his pockets of papers, etc., on desk, L. 3 E.,
while speaking.</i></p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Now if that isn&rsquo;t confoundedly provoking, I&rsquo;d just
like to know what is. There I&rsquo;ve been on a ninety-mile
journey; and what did I gain? Nothing, absolutely nothing,
and just to think of throwing away so much money for
railroad travel, only to have the satisfaction of knowing
that you have added to the pile of monopoly and have
nothing in return. Confound these railroad companies
anyhow! Honest people subscribe to the stock and build
them; then come along these &ldquo;stock jobbing sharks,&rdquo; who
corner the stocks and put the road in their vest-pockets.
And they call that business; but it&rsquo;s only another name for
d&mdash;n robbery. But where is that confounded Coriolanus?
[<i>Calls.</i>] Coriolanus! Coriolanus! Just like the rascal. Whenever
you want him, nowhere to be found. When he is
about, what good is he with his stuck up manners and airs?
Thinks himself born to fill a higher sphere in life. But the
only thing he&rsquo;s good for is to stand him in the entry and
use him for a hat rack. Confound him anyhow! [<i>Calls.</i>]
Coriolanus! [<i>Listens.</i>] Where the deuce can he be? To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
gratify him I answered an advertisement for a position,
which, he says, would be more suitable for his intellectual
and genteel qualities&mdash;and, if it is only successful I shall be
well rid of the rascal. [<i>Picks up letter.</i>] Hello! just the
thing, by jingo! [<i>Reads.</i>] &ldquo;Terms satisfactory. If convenient
come at once. The position is man-servant; but,
as I am away at business during the day, I want a reliable
and intelligent person to supervise the work about the
premises, and be a protector to the females.&rdquo; That will
just please him, and it will just please me to get rid of
him. [<i><span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span> puts his head in C. door.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Cor.</b> Was I mistaken, or did the sound of your voice
penetrate the cavity of my ear?</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Did I call? Well, if that ain&rsquo;t cool! Call? Of
course I did!&mdash;and why the deuce didn&rsquo;t you come immediately?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span> <b>Enters</b>.
</p>

<p><b>Cor.</b> Because, my dear sir, I was otherwise engaged,
and I felt assured that you would indulge me to that extent
and postpone your desires to my especial accommodation.
Thank you! [<i>With a wave of the hand.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Oh! and how in thunder were you engaged?</p>

<p><b>Cor.</b> [<i>Loftily.</i>] I was paring my finger nails.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Oh! Oh! [<i>Falls in chair at desk.</i>] This is too much. To
return travel-wearied and hungry, and be made to wait by
such a jackass. And I must be at court at ten, and [<i>pulls
out watch</i>] it&rsquo;s nine now. [<i>Starts up in a rage.</i>] I&rsquo;ll not
stand it, sir! I&rsquo;ll throw you out of the window!</p>

<p><b>Cor.</b> [<i>R. C.</i>] Indeed! Then I should be at a loss to
wonder what could be the matter with the door. Stay
your temper, sir! It is decidedly unbecoming a man of
your years. Preserve a calm dignity such as I furnish a
striking example of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> [<i>Disgusted.</i>] There, sir! [<i>Hands him letter.</i>] This
is the gratitude I receive for what I have done for you.
Read it, and I hope you will have as much joy of it as I
have in getting rid of you.</p>

<p><b>Cor.</b> Thank you! Thanks! You have performed your
duty well. Some day I will return the kindness; I shall
engage you as my lawyer.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Get out, or I shall be tempted to do you an injury.
Get your things ready to leave to-night, sir! I&rsquo;ll not put
up with your nonsense and impudence another day. Now
go, sir! and order a lunch for me at the restaurant, to be sent
here&mdash;and mind you see that I am not disturbed until
court time. I&rsquo;ve got more than I can do to prepare my
cases for this morning&rsquo;s court. I may forget the flight of
time, in which case you will please come in and remind
me of court time.</p>

<p><b>Cor.</b> Your wishes shall be obeyed. I fly to execute your
orders. [<b>Exit</b> <i>D. R. 4 E.</i>]</p>

magnanimous nature has suffered you to be imposed
upon&mdash;you&rsquo;re a&mdash;[<i><span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span> puts his head in D. R.

<p><b>Cor.</b> I beg your pardon, sir! [<i>He</i> <b>Enters</b>.] In the excitement
of the moment I neglected to inform you that a
lady called to see you. I informed her that you were out
of town. She was much distressed at the information. She
waited for you until eight o&rsquo;clock, when she left in a state
of great mental excitement. She&rsquo;s been waiting since six
o&rsquo;clock this morning, waiting your arrival.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> If she comes back don&rsquo;t let her in. Tell her to
come to-morrow morning. I cannot attend to any more
business before court. [<i>He busies himself among papers.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Cor.</b> [<i>Bows.</i>] I fly! [<b>Exit</b> <i>D. R. 4 E.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Egad! Some people must think lawyers are made
of iron and work like machines! No! I&rsquo;ll listen to no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
more cases before court. I&rsquo;ve only got one head and one

<p><b>Dol.</b> Some one without money to try to enlist my
sympathies in helping some scalawag out of trouble. Not
long ago I defended a tramp whom I thought unjustly
used. I helped him out of the scrape and gave him a bowl
of soup and some alms to help him on&mdash;and how did the
rascal serve me? He published it about the town, and for
two weeks I had every tramp from fifty miles around at
my door begging for soup and alms. You don&rsquo;t get George
Washington Dollerclutch in such a scrape again. [<i>Sees

<p><b>Hil.</b> I was brought up by a family named Wallace,
who live in Norfolk, Virginia, and I supposed that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
was their daughter, until a discovery I made two years ago
convinced me that I was not.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> [<i>Getting interested.</i>] And what discovery did you
make?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> [<i>Unfolding a package.</i>] I found this dress hidden
away in one of the bureau drawers. [<i>Hands it to him.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Lord, bless me! Why, it&rsquo;s a baby dress.</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Yes, sir! and when I made inquiries about it I
learned that it was one I wore when a child.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Well, there was nothing strange about that?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> No, sir! But on examination, I found these initials,
A. M., which you see worked in it!</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Ah! yes! Precisely!</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> And when I called their attention to it they
seemed confused and did not know what to reply. I kept
the dress, determined to find out more, if I could!</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> And you did?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> No, sir! but I learned since that the man I
married could unveil the mystery which shrouds my
birth.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> And won&rsquo;t he enlighten you?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> No, sir! all my attempts have proved futile.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> But did you not say that this man was your husband?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Yes, sir! But he must have some object in keeping
my identity secret.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> But how did you become acquainted with this
man, and how did you come to marry him?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> He was a regular visitor at our home, and I
noticed on many occasions that he paid Mrs. Wallace
money. However, I fell desperately in love with him,
and when he proposed that we get married, I, of course,
was only too happy to consent.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> And his name?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Ralph Murdell!</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Ralph Murdell! Humph! I don&rsquo;t like the name&mdash;got
a bad sound to it.</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> He took me to a little village in the suburbs
about four miles from Norfolk, where we were married in
a little chapel by an old country preacher.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> And you were happy, I suppose?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Yes, until about two weeks later, when he was
about to leave me. He said he had to go North to attend
to some business. I would not listen to it, unless he took
me with him.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> That&rsquo;s right, my girl! And he took you, of
course?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Yes; but it was on condition that I should keep
the marriage a secret, and not recognize him in the presence
of others.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> And what the deuce was that for?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> He said his family were very proud, and he
wanted to gain their consent before he made our marriage
public.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Oh, the rascal! And you listened to him?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Yes, sir! To my sorrow, I did. He recommended
me to a young lady who wanted a lady&rsquo;s maid. I
accepted the position on his assurance that he would soon
claim me before the world as his wife.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> And who is this lady with whom you now are?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Adrienne Lowville!</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> What! The daughter of Wm. Lowville, who
owns Beachwood, eighteen miles from here, on the Essex
road?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Oh, yes, sir! Do you know him?</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Well, I&rsquo;d like to know who don&rsquo;t! Got a railroad
in each pocket. But, about your husband&mdash;is he acquainted
there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Alas! yes! He is a constant visitor, and I more
than suspect that his attentions to my mistress imply more
than he wishes me to believe.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> [<i>Throws baby dress on table, R. 3 E.</i>] Oh! That&rsquo;s
his game, is it? A case of throwing you over for her, eh?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> I fear so, sir; for she is madly in love with him,
and thinks him a saint. When I called him to account for
his actions, he laughed at me. He then informed me that
he would do as he pleased, and that I was not his wife at
all; that ours was a mock marriage.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> [<i>Jumps up.</i>] The deuce he did! Oh, the villain,
to take advantage of a poor innocent girl.</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> [<i>Rises.</i>] Oh, sir! but it was legal&mdash;it&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> [<i><span class="smcap">Dollerclutch</span> L. C., <span class="smcap">Hilda</span> R. C.</i>] Have you got
your marriage certificate?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> No, sir! I never thought of that, sir.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Then, what proof have you?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Alas, none! But, oh sir! can&rsquo;t you investigate it?
There surely must be a record kept of all marriages. Can&rsquo;t
you get a copy of the church register, where it must have
been entered?</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> That&rsquo;s so! I never thought of that! But, my dear
girl, that will be a difficult matter, now that the country is
in a <i>furore</i> and on the verge of a civil war; and it will cost
money to do it, my dear girl; money.</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> [<i>Crosses to desk L. 3 E.</i>] Oh, sir! I thought of
that! Here are twelve dollars that I saved out of my
scanty earnings. Won&rsquo;t it be enough, sir?</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> [<i>Up C.</i>] Enough? Why, it wouldn&rsquo;t pay for dipping
a pen into the ink, to say nothing about the trouble of
licking a postage stamp.</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> [<i>Sobs.</i>] What shall I do&mdash;what shall I do?</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> [<i>Taking out handkerchief.</i>] Take up that money
and put it in your pocket immediately! I&rsquo;ll not take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>

<p><b>Hil.</b> [<i>C.</i>] Oh, won&rsquo;t you help me out of my trouble?</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Help you? Of course I will! Who said I wouldn&rsquo;t?
Do you think I&rsquo;ll stand by and see an innocent girl
wronged in this manner? No! I&rsquo;ll see this thing through,
if it costs me a fortune! Oh, the villain! [<i><span class="smcap">Dollerclutch</span>

idea. This is business, I tell you; business. What do you
know about business, I&rsquo;d like to know?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> I beg your pardon, sir!</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Why do you come and arouse my sympathetic
heart, and upset all my court business?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Can I do aught, sir?</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> No&mdash;yes&mdash;that is&mdash;shut up! Give me that dress!

anything. [<i>Puts on his hat, etc. <span class="smcap">Dollerclutch</span> at

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Because I hate these empty shows. What are all
these receptions but one maze of dissipation, where everybody
seems to outdo the other in silliness?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> I agree with you there, Henry. There are many
sins and much hypocrisy and deceit practiced under the
veil of studied politeness, and the sacred bond of friendship
becomes a mere matter of form to further the ends of
frivolous and sordid desires.</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> And the women! All deception, heartless, fickle.
Show me a woman in this gilded age of fashion devoid of
fashion&rsquo;s impress&mdash;devoid of&mdash;</p>

attributes that Heaven instilled in her heart, that make her
all that is beautiful and endearing in the eyes of a true

my offense, and if a life&rsquo;s devotion could repay it, command
me.</p>

has been wise, and that she will prove an honor to my son

<p><b>Mor.</b> I sincerely hope so, my son! but I fear you have
made a great mistake. You may have loved well, but I
fear too unwisely.</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Father, you are mistaken in Adrienne. She is all
that is noble&mdash;as free from deceit and the taint of the world
as a child unborn. No, no, father! she is all that an
honorable man could wish.</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> For your sake, I wish I could think as you do, but
I cannot. Did she love you as a wife should, she would
honor her husband so much as to show her respect, at

of your welcome. But consider her fatigue.
Time will command the respect and love due her husband&rsquo;s
father.</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Love is a spontaneous outburst of the heart. It is
not of gradual growth. It takes not time to discover true
innate worth in a person. Love detects it at a glance,
and time only confirms the first impression. My son, is
she all that you desire?</p>

</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Adrienne!</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> [<i>R. C. Turns.</i>] Your pleasure, Reginald!</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> [<i>Quietly, but firmly.</i>] Adrienne, I desire a few moments&rsquo;
conversation. What I have to say is for your ears
only!</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> Proceed, Reginald. I hear you!</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Adrienne, the time has come when I must speak&mdash;I
can no longer bear the cold, dignified reserve with which
you treat me&mdash;your husband. There is a motive for all
things&mdash;and there must be a motive that prompts your
action. We are man and wife, and open candor and frankness
should exist between us.</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> Have I not fulfilled my duty, sir? Have I not
shown you the honor and respect that you have a right
to demand from a wife?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> You have honored and respected me, Adrienne, but
I have a right to expect even more.</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> I do not understand!</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> I have a right to expect your love! [<i><span class="smcap">Adrienne</span>
retreats a step, her hand pressed to her heart.</i>] Yes, Adrienne!
Marriage is a holy act which ought to be based on the
rock of love; else it becomes a sordid and disgraceful bargain,
devoid of sacredness and heavenly sanction. [<i>She
recoils.</i>] When I led you to the altar it was with the firm belief
that our marriage would be a holy and sacred bond,
founded upon the eternal principle of love. But your manner
since has caused me to doubt the sincerity of your
heart.</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> [<i>Haughtily.</i>] Did I, when I accepted your hand,
say that I returned your love?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> No! In my eyes you were an ideal woman, of
the highest and noblest sentiment&mdash;devoid of worldly ambition
and desire. That was sufficient. Could I then
doubt the feeling which actuated your acceptance of my
heart and hand? [<i>Slight pause.</i>] Adrienne! say that I am
not disappointed in you&mdash;say that your sacred vow at the
altar, &ldquo;to love, honor and obey,&rdquo; was not a hollow sham&mdash;speak,
Adrienne, speak! [<i>Pause. <span class="smcap">Reginald</span> turns away.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> [<i>Recovering slowly.</i>] I will be honest with you,
sir! You have a right to know. Could I but recall those
fatal words that bound me for life to one I can never
love, I would willingly lay down my life. I refused you
when you first offered yourself, because I loved another.
When I witnessed his perfidy, a few moments later, in a
fit of pique, I accepted you. When I recovered from the
mad impulse that swayed my being, I awakened to the
misery into which I had plunged myself, and I almost
hated you for tempting me to this agonizing bondage.</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> [<i>With intense feeling suppressed.</i>] Madam, the die
is cast! You bear my name&mdash;you are my wife&mdash;that can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>not
be recalled, for that is recorded above. You will ever
receive at my hands the respect that is due my wife. I
shall provide for and protect you as long as He, in His
good mercy, does grant me life. You will always find
this, my paternal home, yours to enjoy.</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> [<i>Alarmed.</i>] What would you do?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Madam, it must be evident to you that my hopes
in life are blighted; that I would not weary your sight
with the presence of one who would be a constant reproach
to your misery and folly. I will leave you. Perhaps
the day may come when your heart may change
and turn toward the husband. If so, the words, &ldquo;Reginald,
I love you&mdash;come back,&rdquo; will bring to your bosom
the husband, who will always be true to his sacred vow
at the altar. [<i>Crosses to L.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> When did you hear from home last, Reginald?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> A week ago.</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> And how is your little Alice?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> When last I heard, she was well. Oh, Henry!
she is the only joy in my life. The future of my child
is the only thing that keeps me from despair. I live in
hopes that I shall one day clasp my child to my bosom.
Oh, the yearning of a father&rsquo;s heart! And now that we
are so near to her, I almost feel tempted to shirk my
duty and satisfy the longing to see my beloved child.</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> We are only six miles away from your home, I
believe you said?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Yes! day by day have we been drawing closer
to it. And it is nearly four years since I left the scene,
never to return to it again. [<i>He turns away.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Reginald, I sincerely sympathize with you in
your trouble. [<i>Takes him by the hand.</i>] Adrienne has
wronged you deeply. She&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> [<i>Checks him.</i>] Henry, she is your sister, but do
not forget that she is my <i>wife</i>. I cannot listen to her
condemnation even from you.</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Well, Reginald, I respect your wishes. But cheer
up! I have faith to believe that all will be right again&mdash;that
some day will see you reunited and happy.</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> [<i>Shakes his head.</i>] This will be my only happiness,
Henry. [<i>Shows picture of child.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Is this the picture of my niece? Why, she doesn&rsquo;t
look a bit like Adrienne!</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> No! the resemblance is to <i>my</i> family. I can now
readily understand why my father wrote to me, soon after
the child&rsquo;s birth, asking the privilege of naming it. She
bears a striking resemblance to my little sister.</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Your sister! I never knew you had a sister!</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> No! because that is the skeleton in our family
closet. Her name was Alice. When but three months
old she was stolen from the cradle. All effort to recover
the child proved fruitless. Her disappearance has since
remained a mystery. Grief over our loss brought my
mother to an early grave. My father sacrificed his all in
the hope of recovering the child, but all his efforts proved
unavailing. This happened eighteen years ago, and we
know not whether she be living or not, but we mourn
her as dead.</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> And had you no suspicion as to who stole the
child?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> None. My father did not think he had an enemy
in the world.</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Strange! very strange! The ways of Providence
are mysterious, and we must bow with resignation to His
Divine Will. One moment, Reginald. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Adolphus</span>.</i>]
Adolphus!</p>

<p><b>Adol.</b> [<i>Salutes.</i>] Captain, I await your orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Go to the officers&rsquo; tent and inquire whether the
mail has arrived.</p>

<p><b>Adol.</b> [<i>Salutes.</i>] All right, Captain! [<b>Exit</b> <i>L. 1 E.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> [<i>To <span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span>.</i>] Coriolanus! [<i><span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span> rises
and salutes.</i>] Take his post as sentinel! [<i><span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span>
salutes and takes his post. To <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>.</i>] It is remarkable
what a change there is in Adolphus. When I drafted him
I thought he would make a poor soldier, he was so cowardly;
but he has turned out to be one of the bravest
men in the regiment. A soldier&rsquo;s life has made a man of
him.</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> It has, indeed! I have often wanted to ask you
what ever became of his chum, Sammy. I thought you
had drafted him, also.</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> I did; but he had plenty of money, and furnished
a substitute. I wish the mail would arrive.
[<i>Rises.</i>] By the way, Reginald, did your last letter mention
anything about any of the rest of your household?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> [<i>Rises.</i>] For instance, Hilda? Ha! ha! ha! Oh,
you sly rogue! Henry, I remember a conversation we
had, when you asked me to show you a woman devoid
of fashion&rsquo;s frivolities&mdash;ha! ha! ha! Perhaps, now <i>you</i>
can show one&mdash;ha! ha! ha! What! Henry, the recluse,
the woman-hater, in love with a woman? Wonderful!
Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Well, I&rsquo;ll acknowledge the corn; but I didn&rsquo;t
know a sensible woman until I met Hilda Wallace,
whose quiet and unassuming manners struck the chord of
affinity in my nature.</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> [<i>Takes him by the hand.</i>] Well, well, I&rsquo;m glad of the
transformation, and I hope your future will not be marred
by disappointment. [<i><span class="smcap">Dollerclutch</span> snores.</i>]</p>

[<i><span class="smcap">Dollerclutch</span> talks again.</i>] But, listen!</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> [<i>Starting.</i>] The rebs are coming&mdash;the rebs are

stay here. [<i>Sits upright.</i>] Don&rsquo;t shoot! [<i>He fights imaginary

<p><b>Hen.</b> Look out! the rebs are coming! Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> [<i>Getting on his feet. Aside.</i>] Confound it all! I
must have been dreaming.</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Ha! ha! ha! We&rsquo;ve found you out at last, old
Dollerclutch. You are a <i>brave</i> man, George Washington.
I thought I never did see you when we went into an
engagement&mdash;now I can account for it.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> [<i>L. C.</i>] Sir! I have always been where the fight
was thickest.</p>

<p><b>Cor.</b> [<i>Aside.</i>] After it was over.</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> <i>You</i> mean George Washington was&mdash;but I mean
George Washington Dollerclutch.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Sir! Do you mean to insinuate that my bravery
is a matter of doubt? You wrong me, sir! You wrong
me, I can assure you. My deeds of valor have saved the
day many a time&mdash;many a time. Do you understand? But
my modesty won&rsquo;t allow me to speak of them. Even in
my childhood was I noted for my bravery. I took Mrs.
Winslow&rsquo;s soothing syrup with the most unflinching cour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>age.
Nothing would delight me more than a hand-to-hand
encounter with a whole regiment of rebels. I
would glory in the chance, sir! I have smelt powder
many times. [<i>He shoots off his revolver, smells the smoke

<p><b>Anas.</b> War, and war, and war&mdash;and nothing but war!
What earthly sense can there be in a lot of men standing
up to be shot at, I&rsquo;d like to know? Men making targets of
themselves for others to practice shooting at! If they
want to shoot so bad there are enough shooting galleries,
where they can bang away to their hearts&rsquo; content. But
that&rsquo;s just the way with the men. They always will be
doing things they ought not to. If the women only had
the control of the Government, there would not be
any war&mdash;never! Everything would be peace and harmony.</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> [<i>R. C.</i>] Good morning, sister! Where is my little

<p><b>Anas.</b> Out in the garden with her mother and Hilda.</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> [<i>Anxiously.</i>] I am almost afraid to let them venture
out of the house for fear there might be some rebels
lurking in the neighborhood.</p>

<p><b>Anas.</b> [<i>Drops knitting and rises.</i>] Good gracious,
brother Morris! There is no danger of the fighting coming
so close?</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> It is hard to tell how it will be. Warfare is very
uncertain, although I do not think there is any immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
danger. The rebels are fleeing towards the north-west,
out of our track entirely. The Union forces are but six
miles to our west.</p>

<p><b>Anas.</b> What if they should turn back? What will become
of us?</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> True; but I believe the greatest danger is past!
The rebels have a determined pursuer, who will not be
forced back. Grant is not the man to acknowledge defeat.
He has entered the fight to win, and I have faith in him to
believe that he will not turn his back upon the rebels until
he has forced them to submission.</p>

<p><b>Anas.</b> Just to think that we might all have been shot
and cut up&mdash;ugh! It makes my blood run cold.</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> But the danger is not entirely over. The enemy
is getting desperate. Their supplies are cut off, and I fear
some depredation from foraging parties. I must caution
them not to go out of sight of the house, and not to allow
Alice out of hearing. It would tear my heart-strings
should harm come to my darling little Alice.</p>

<p><b>Anas.</b> Bless the sweet child! How she does grow.
Ah! brother, she looks more and more like our poor lost
Alice every day.</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Anastasia! I beg of you do not re-open the old
wound. Revive not the bitter memories of the past,
which still have power to renew the agony of a father&rsquo;s

<p><b>Adri.</b> Alas, yes! We are apt to question sometimes,

<p><b>Adri.</b> Nay, Hilda! I deeply sympathize with you in
your trouble, and I feel assured that your villainous husband
will, some day, meet the punishment he so richly
deserves.</p>

your happiness, also. It makes me shudder to think of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> Yes, Hilda! but Heaven saved me from such a

was so blinded to his real character as to love him.
Thank Heaven, my eyes have been opened to his treachery
and baseness.</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Oh, my lady! I am so glad to know that you forgave
my silence about his true character.</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> I could not blame you, Hilda. It was a bitter
lesson, and I can only reproach my folly for listening to
his ardent appeals of love. I thought him a gentleman of
the highest honor, worthy of the love of a virtuous and
innocent girl. But your exposure of his utter depravity
has saved me from despair. It has awakened me to a
keen sense of the great injustice I have done him who has
honored me with his name&mdash;my husband. Oh, the
agony I have inflicted upon that noble, trusting heart!
Oh, that it was I that drove him from me by my wretched
cruelty!&mdash;perhaps to meet his death upon the gory field of
battle.</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Oh, Adrienne! then you love him?</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> Love him, Hilda! Yea. I worship him. The
grand nobility of his soul has inspired my heart with the
strong, undying love of the wife.</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> And does Reginald know of the change of your
heart?</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> Alas, no! Pride&mdash;foolish pride&mdash;has kept me from
making the confession to him.</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Adrienne, let me beseech you, then, to write to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
at once, and bring the sunshine of joy to his wretched
heart. Do not mar your own happiness by withholding
the true state of your feelings. Think of your child&mdash;your
darling Alice. Do not deprive her future of the happiness
of a father&rsquo;s love.</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> I am so unworthy of him. Can he&mdash;will he forgive?
[<i>Aside.</i>] His words when he left me&mdash;&ldquo;Perhaps in

<p><b>Mor.</b> God bless you, my daughter!</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> You here?</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Forgive me, Adrienne, for being a listener. But I
am glad, for it has convinced me how much I had wronged
you in my thoughts. It has shown me the true and loving
heart of a woman&mdash;of a true and loyal wife, who can yet
be a pride to the loving heart of a husband, and a joy in
the declining years of his father. I have treated you
coldly, harshly, unjustly. I knew not the cause&mdash;the
motive of your action. I looked but upon the result. I
now ask, in all humility and deference, your forgiveness.
[<i>He kneels to her.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> Rise, most noble sir! I have naught to forgive!
I, alone, am to blame. I have merited your censure by
my conduct. Heaven grant it may not be too late to restore
to your arms an honored and dutiful son, and to me a
cherished and beloved husband.</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> Nay, Reginald, I cannot let you go again.</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Alas! Adrienne, you must bear the separation
calmly, for my sake and for the child&rsquo;s. I left my post
without permission, and should my absence be discovered
I shall be court-martialed. A few hours ago I feared not
the consequences of my rash act. But now I dread it, for
your sake. I must return at once, while there is yet time.
Let the thoughts of our child be your strength in my absence,
as she will be mine in the heat of battle. May the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>

<p><b>Adri.</b> [<i>Starts up joyfully.</i>] Reginald! [<i>Sees it is

<p><b>Ralph.</b> [<i>Comes down R. Sneeringly.</i>] Even I, Adrienne,
your humble servant!</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> What means this intrusion, sir, at this hour of the
night?</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> I never had the pleasure of congratulating you
before on your happy marriage!</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> Sir, you will oblige me by leaving this house!</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> [<i>Aside.</i>] That cut, did it? [<i>To <span class="smcap">Adrienne</span>.</i>] Pardon
me, madam, but if you will allow me to offer my
sincere sympathy for your loveless married life&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> Leave this house instantly, or I will call assistance
to eject you forcibly!</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> Ha! ha! ha! I made sure there was no one
about to disturb us ere I entered.</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> Just this! That there is not a soul within the
reach of your voice. We are alone. But listen to me,
Adrienne. I do not wish you harm&mdash;on the contrary, I
offer you happiness.</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> I do not understand you, sir!</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> When you married Reginald Maitland, it was
not because you loved him, but to gratify a feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
pique. You gave him your hand, but not your heart.
That belonged to me! I have watched your husband
every day and have read the unhappiness and misery that
he tries to conceal. Adrienne, you are unhappy in the
bonds that tie you to a loveless life. Therefore, fly with
me, and I will show you a life&rsquo;s loving devotion&mdash;a
life&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> Enough! Do not pollute further the sanctity of a
true and honest husband&rsquo;s roof with the vile utterances of
depraved villainy. My husband I adore, and I will be
loyal to him and faithful unto death. Your influence over
my heart is forever broken, and I would sooner suffer death,
aye, a thousand times, than to listen to another word from
you, whom I hate and despise&mdash;yea, whom I loathe more
than a viper in my path! Go, and may Heaven have
mercy on your soul! [<i>She turns away in majestic contempt.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> [<i>Sees <span class="smcap">Reginald&rsquo;s</span> gun and takes it.</i>] Curse you!

more definite news of the movements of the main
body. We will, therefore, continue in camp till I give you
further instructions.</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> According to all reports, the rebs are badly crippled,
and Lee cannot hold out much longer. At all
events, I should not be surprised to hear of his surrender
to Grant in the near future.</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Yes, there is all prospect of a speedy ending of
this bloody strife, and I hope we will soon have peace
restored, that we may be enabled to return to our homes
and families! [<i>About to rise.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> One moment, Colonel! before you go! It is
with regret that I must call your attention to a private in

fact!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Surely, Major, you must be mistaken!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Reginald Maitland&mdash;a soldier ever ready to respond
to the call of duty; always fulfilling his orders in
the most praiseworthy manner&mdash;he desert his post?
[<i>Shakes his head.</i>] Please explain, Major!</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> &rsquo;Tis surprising, indeed! but, nevertheless, a
fact! I saw him leave myself&mdash;he seemed to be greatly

night?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> I was, sir!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Did you fulfill your duty to the letter? [<i><span class="smcap">Reginald</span>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Colonel Morrell, it is with shame I acknowledge
that I have proved unfaithful to my duty&mdash;I deserted my
post, sir!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Maitland, it pains me to know that you, on whose
honor and probity I would have staked my existence,
should be guilty of this offense. It is with regret that I am
obliged to perform the duty which devolves upon me!</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Colonel, the offense is a grave one. I have
merited the punishment it demands. I am ready to receive
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> What was your motive in forsaking duty?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> It was an uncontrollable impulse to see my child,
whom I had never seen before, that swayed my being&mdash;I
knew not what I did! My heart was filled with a mad
desire to see my child. Duty, honor, all was forgotten. I
could not resist the longing, the yearning of the father, but
I followed the impulse which completely overpowered my
reason.</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> And do you know that the penalty for your
offense, according to the rules and regulations of war, is
death?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> I do! and I will not shrink from receiving my punishment.
I am ready, Colonel, to receive sentence.</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> [<i>Aside.</i>] As fearless and brave as a lion!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> [<i>Aside.</i>] No! I cannot do it! [<i>To <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>.</i>]
Maitland, under the circumstances, and in consideration of
your past praiseworthy service, and your undaunted
gallantry in action, I will not execute the punishment
which the offense merits.</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> [<i>Aside.</i>] Bravo, Colonel!</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> [<i>Aside.</i>] Curse his sympathy!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> But I cannot let the matter pass unnoticed. I
place you under arrest for three weeks. You will be confined
in the guard-house under close surveillance. Private
Softhead, deprive him of his arms and accoutrements, and
conduct him in disgrace to the guard-house. [<i><span class="smcap">Adolphus</span>

<p><b>Hen.</b> [<i>Aside to <span class="smcap">Morrell</span>.</i>] These are hard lines,

<p><b>Mor.</b> [<i>Aside to <span class="smcap">Henry</span>.</i>] Yes, Captain! I regret it sincerely!

gave me so much pain. But duty, as a true soldier, demanded
it!</p>

Reginald Maitland! No! I will wager my life on his
innocence!</p>

share your opinion!</p>

with you! I cannot believe so noble a character invested
with so foul a heart! Let us investigate the proofs! [<i>He

Maitland prowling about the premises in a cautious and
suspicious manner, and that he saw him enter the house

when the deed was committed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> That evidence proves nothing, Colonel.</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> It is very significant though!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> One moment, gentlemen! [<i>Reads.</i>] &ldquo;I also inclose
a piece of blackened paper, evidently the wadding of
the gun&mdash;also a bullet which we found imbedded in the
wall.&rdquo; [<i>He pulls blackened paper from envelope&mdash;he smells

<p><b>Mor.</b> [<i>Takes bullet from envelope.</i>] The fatal bullet!
[<i>Examines it.</i>] Here are two letters on it, R. M.</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> Gentlemen, the evidence is conclusive&mdash;he is
guilty.</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Do not be hasty, Major! I am not yet satisfied
of his guilt. [<i>Aside.</i>] I fear the worst. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Adolphus</span>.</i>]
Adolphus! conduct Private Maitland here at once! [<i><span class="smcap">Adolphus</span>

<p><b>Reg.</b> [<i>Recoiling.</i>] Murder? I, Colonel? I accused of

<p><b>Mor.</b> Yes, you!</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> [<i>Quietly.</i>] Whom am I accused of murdering?</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Your wife!</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> [<i>Staggers.</i>] My wife?&mdash;my wife? my Adrienne
murdered?&mdash;merciful father! [<i>Pause. With forced calmness.</i>]
I beg your pardon, Colonel, but I pray you make
me not a victim of such cruel jest! [<i><span class="smcap">Morrell</span> turns away.</i>]
No! no! Tell me &rsquo;tis but a jest&mdash;tell me it is not true. Oh,

[<i>He is silent. To <span class="smcap">Henry</span>.</i>] Henry, end this suspense, this

with your wife?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> About nine o&rsquo;clock!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Did you have your gun with you?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> I did!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> When did you load it last, and where?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Yesterday morning, in my tent!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Did you discharge it since?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> No, sir!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Is it still loaded?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> It is, sir!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Major Murdell, hand me Maitland&rsquo;s gun. [<i>He examines
it.</i>] Gentlemen, the gun has been discharged! [<i>He
hands gun back&mdash;he then hands <span class="smcap">Reginald</span> blackened paper.</i>]
Do you recognize that paper?</p>

from my father! I used it for wadding.</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Do you recognize this bullet? [<i>Hands it.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> [<i>Examines.</i>] It is from my mould.</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Did you have any ill feeling against your wife?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> None!</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> Colonel, I can prove that there has existed bad
feeling between them since their marriage!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Make your statement!</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> They lived unhappily together until an open
rupture caused him to leave her and enlist in the army.</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Your proof! [<i><span class="smcap">Ralph</span> points to <span class="smcap">Henry</span>.</i>] Lowville,
do you corroborate Major Murdell&rsquo;s assertion? [<i><span class="smcap">Henry</span>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Speak, Henry!</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> [<i>Aside.</i>] Must I speak? [<i>After a pause, to <span class="smcap">Morrell</span>.</i>]
I do!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> [<i>To <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>.</i>] What was the nature of the
rupture?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> I decline to answer.</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> That was his motive for the crime!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Silence! [<i>To <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>.</i>] In the face of the evidence,
I am forced to believe you guilty. I regret that a
soldier such as you have heretofore proved yourself to be,
should come to such an ignominious end. [<i><span class="smcap">Ralph</span> consulting
with others. <span class="smcap">Henry</span> walks aside.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Do you believe me guilty, Colonel? [<i>He turns
from <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>.</i>] And do you all think me guilty of this
cowardly crime? [<i>They all look away but <span class="smcap">Henry</span>, who
takes <span class="smcap">Reginald</span> by the hand.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> No! I would believe you innocent, had they ten
times the evidence.</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> The evidence has proven his guilt most conclusively!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> [<i>To <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>.</i>] Have you anything to say why I
should not pass sentence upon you?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> I have not!</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Oh, Reginald, why do you not defend yourself?
Why not make an effort to prove your innocence?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Henry, what have I to live for now? Adrienne is
gone from me. She has left the world dark and dreary to
me. I long to join her there! [<i>Points upward.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Prove your innocence. Let not the stain of murder
rest on your honorable name!</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Henry, this is but the judgment of men. I bow to
the judgment of Him alone who knoweth all things. He
knows I am innocent&mdash;that is sufficient. I am satisfied!
His will be done! [<i>To <span class="smcap">Morrell</span>.</i>] Colonel, I await your
orders!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> [<i>Aside.</i>] I would I could believe him innocent.
The evidence condemns him! [<i>Sighs.</i>] I must fulfill my
duty! [<i>To <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>.</i>] Maitland, the evidence that has
been brought to bear shows conclusively that you are
guilty! Nothing remains but for me to pass sentence. I
therefore condemn you to be shot until you are dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
[<i><span class="smcap">Reginald</span> bows his head.</i>] The sentence shall be executed
immediately. I will allow you five minutes to prepare
yourself to meet your God! [<i>Takes out watch. To <span class="smcap">Ralph</span>.</i>]
Major! you will detail your men to execute the order.
[<i><span class="smcap">Ralph</span> whispers to <span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span> and <span class="smcap">Adolphus</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> [<i>To <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>.</i>] Reginald, this is terrible! The
Colonel has no right to use such haste. The evidence is
purely circumstantial, and should require deeper investigation!</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Nay, do not blame Colonel Morrell; he has simply
done his duty. Besides, why should the execution be deferred?
Why should I longer drag out a miserable existence?
I will soon be happy, Henry, for I shall meet
Adrienne. But my child, Henry! my darling little Alice!
Take her, Henry&mdash;be a father to her&mdash;guide her footsteps
in the path of honor and virtue. Teach her not to despise
her father&mdash;that he is innocent. Teach her not to listen to
the sneers of the world, but to place an everlasting faith in
the Father of us all, so that at the last she will find peace
and joy in the beautiful realms above!</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> I accept the trust, Reginald. God grant I will be
faithful to it. [<i>They shake hands.</i>] Have you any further
wishes?</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Tell my father I am innocent&mdash;that will be sufficient&mdash;he
will believe me. Now leave me, Henry!</p>

</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> [<i>C.</i>] Hold! If you shoot that man you commit
murder! He is innocent!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> [<i>R. C.</i>] What mean you?</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> Will you allow this interference, Colonel?</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Yes! God forbid that I should shoot an innocent
man! [<i>To <span class="smcap">Dollerclutch</span>.</i>] Your proofs!</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> My proofs are crushing! There is no murder!
[<i><span class="smcap">Reginald</span> pulls off handkerchief.</i>] His wife lives. She is
even now on her way to this camp!</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Adrienne lives? Thanks be to God!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> How do you know this?</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> I overtook her on the road on my way to camp.
She was almost exhausted, and begged of me to run on
and save Reginald from being shot for her murder. I did
so, and here I am, just in the nick of time! By jingo, I
feel so good, I could shake hands with the greatest
scoundrel that ever breathed. [<i>He shakes <span class="smcap">Ralph&rsquo;s</span> hand.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> Colonel, you surely will not be imposed upon by
that rascal&rsquo;s concocted story?</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Silence! If she is not dead, it was not the fault
of the intended murderer. He meant to kill her, and the
intent is sufficient for which to carry out the penalty!</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> [<i>R. C.</i>] Correct, Colonel! But that man is not the
one who attempted the murder. I swear that Reginald
Maitland left the house fifteen minutes before the shot was
fired. I was watching one whom I know to be the murderer,
prowling around the house; but looking after Maitland&rsquo;s
departure, I lost sight of the other chap. Some time
after I heard the shot and rushed into the house and into
the arms of the attempted assassin, who was trying to es<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>cape.
I struggled to overpower him, but he was too much
for me. [<i>Rubs his side and grimaces.</i>] He got away. I
pursued, but he got off in the darkness. In my eagerness
to catch him, I fell into the hands of the rebels.</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> And how did you get away from the rebels?</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> This morning, by indomitable bravery and courage,
I fought my way out of their lines and hastened back
here to camp.</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Who is the man that attempted the deed?</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> The room was dark; the scoundrel had put out the
light; I could not recognize him!</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> [<i>Aside.</i>] Safe! safe!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> How do you know, then, that it was not Maitland?</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> In the struggle, the villain&rsquo;s ring slipped into my
hand. Here it is, Colonel! [<i><span class="smcap">Morrell</span> takes and examines
it.</i>] Later I also found this shoulder strap hanging to one
of my buttons. [<i><span class="smcap">Morrell</span> hands ring to <span class="smcap">Ralph</span>.</i>] Colonel,
do privates wear these things?</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> Colonel, here are some letters engraved on the
seal&mdash;R. M. Reginald Maitland!</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> You lie! R. M.&mdash;Ralph Murdell, and here is where
this belongs, you cowardly assassin! [<i>He claps the
shoulder strap on <span class="smcap">Ralph&rsquo;s</span> shoulder, which is minus one.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Men, secure him! [<i><span class="smcap">Adolphus</span> and <span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span> do

<p><b>Ralph.</b> [<i>To <span class="smcap">Dollerclutch</span>.</i>] Curse you for a meddlesome
hound!</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> I said I would, and so I did, by jingo!</p>

she is very pale and exhausted. <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>

<p><b>Adri.</b> Reginald, my husband!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Adrienne! [<i>She falls in his arms half fainting.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> Safe! safe! You are safe!</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Yes, yes, my wife. Heaven is just! You have
been spared to me by His great mercy.</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> [<i>Approaching them.</i>] Pardon me, Maitland, for
interrupting. Allow me to ask you one question, Madam?
[<i>She nods.</i>] Who was it that fired the shot?</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> [<i>Pointing to <span class="smcap">Ralph</span>.</i>] There stands the coward
who, failing in his effort to make me unfaithful to my true
and loyal husband, attempted to murder me!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> [<i>To <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>, taking his hand.</i>] Forgive me,
Maitland, for entertaining one moment the thought that
you were guilty of such cowardly villainy! I have
wronged you deeply.</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> I have naught to forgive, Colonel; you have acted
only as a true soldier, and, had you not done as you did,
you would have neglected your duty.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Enter</b> <i><span class="smcap">Hilda</span>, R. 4 E.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> [<i>L. C., to <span class="smcap">Adrienne</span>.</i>] You are safe, Adrienne. You
rushed from the house in your frantic excitement. I feared
your mind was wandering.</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> Nay, Hilda! When I learned that my husband
was accused of my supposed murder, I dreaded the
consequences, and determined to save him ere it was too
late.</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> They knew not where you had fled. But I knew
where your heart would lead you, and I followed.</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> [<i>Aside.</i>] What a wealth of true womanly feeling
is hidden by her quiet demeanor! [<i>To <span class="smcap">Hilda</span>.</i>] Will you
be kind enough to enlighten us, how it was that we received
news from the Chief of Police that Adrienne was
murdered?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> When we found her last night, we supposed her to
be dead, until this morning I thought I detected signs of
life. I begged of them to summon a physician at once.
He pronounced her alive, but in a death-like stupor.
After hard work she was restored to consciousness. Examination
of her wound showed that the bullet had only
grazed the head, inflicting a scalp wound, but sufficient to
effectually stun her.</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Kind Providence turned the bullet&rsquo;s fatal course,
but it was almost the means of bringing a noble life to an
ignominious end. [<i>Pointing to <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Have you discovered the real culprit?</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Yes! he is there! [<i>Points to <span class="smcap">Ralph</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> [<i>Staggers.</i>] Ralph!&mdash;my husband?</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Your husband? Is that man your husband?</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> Alas! yes! With what feelings of loathing must I
make the acknowledgment.</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> Bah! you she-devil! I never married you&mdash;you
were only a mistress!</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> You lie, you black-hearted villain!</p>

<p><b>Hil.</b> [<i>Producing papers.</i>] You could ruin my character
in the eyes of the world did I not possess this! [<i>Holding
paper aloft.</i>] The record of my marriage to you. [<i><span class="smcap">Ralph</span>
recoils.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> [<i>To <span class="smcap">Ralph</span>.</i>] And I was the individual who saved
that girl from your base villainy! I&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;I!</p>

<p><b>Ralph.</b> Curse you!</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> [<i>Aside.</i>] Alas for my hopes!</p>

<p class="center"><b>Enter</b> <i><span class="smcap">Morris</span> and <span class="smcap">Anastasia</span>, R. 4 E.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Anas.</b> [<i>Going to <span class="smcap">Adrienne</span> and embracing her.</i>] You
dear child! How glad I am that we&rsquo;ve found you at last!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Heaven be praised, my daughter, I find you safe.
[<i>He embraces <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>.</i>] My son!</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Father!</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> I am overjoyed at this happy union of loving
hearts. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Hilda</span>.</i>] Alice, my child! [<i>Beckons her to
come. To <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>.</i>] Reginald, God has been merciful
to restore to us your lost sister&mdash;my darling daughter,
Alice!</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> My sister?</p>

<p><b>All.</b> Your daughter?</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> Yes! my daughter! [<i>Embraces her.</i>] After
many years of suffering and anguish has Heaven sent me
the joy that I thought was buried in the past. [<i>Takes
<b>Dollerclutch</b> by the hand.</i>] Here is the instrument of
Providence who saved an innocent girl and brought happiness
to a father&rsquo;s heart. [<i><span class="smcap">Hilda</span> converses with <span class="smcap">Henry</span>.</i>]
Bless your kind heart! How can I ever repay you?</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Tut! tut! tut! I acted only on business&mdash;only on
business, sir!&mdash;do you understand? Entirely on business&mdash;without
any kindness whatever. I am more than repaid
when I see the happiness and joy that surrounds me! [<i>He
goes to <span class="smcap">Anastasia</span>. Up L. C.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Mor.</b> That man&rsquo;s father [<i>pointing to <span class="smcap">Ralph</span></i>] was the
wretch who stole the child from our parental bosom! His
father and I aspired for the hand of the same lady&mdash;I was
the successful one. He, being of a very passionate and
revengeful nature, darkened our domestic bliss by stealing
from the cradle our youngest child, Alice! I did not think
I had an enemy in the world who could be guilty of such
baseness, until last night I received the proof which exposed
him and restored to me a daughter. All doubts of her
identity were removed by the discovery of a mole
behind her left ear, which we remembered our child&rsquo;s
having.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Morrell.</b> I congratulate you, sir, upon your new found joy!
The mills of justice grind slowly sometimes, but they
are sure. Righteousness and truth will always receive
its blessed reward. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span> and <span class="smcap">Adolphus</span>.</i>] Men,
remove the depraved scoundrel to the guard house and
see that he is strongly guarded. [<i>They do so.</i> <b>Exit</b>
<i><span class="smcap">Ralph</span>, <span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span> and <span class="smcap">Adolphus</span>, R. 2 E.</i>] It is a pity to
mar the happiness of this hour with the presence of such a
vile and cowardly rascal! [<i>To <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>.</i>] Maitland, in
consideration of the terrible mistake and injustice by
which I almost sacrificed your life, I hereby revoke the
order for your disgrace and restore you to honorable recognition
by promoting you to the position of Major!</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> Bravo, Colonel!</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Good! your heart is in the right place, Colonel!
[<i>Aside.</i>] And so is mine! [<i>Turning to <span class="smcap">Anastasia</span>.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> [<i>Taking <span class="smcap">Morrell</span> by the hand.</i>] Thanks, Colonel,
thanks!</p>

<p><b>Morrell.</b> Do not thank me, Maitland; you are more than
deserving. Had you accepted promotion before when it
was offered, for your gallant conduct and bravery on the
field, you would long since have been even my superior
officer. [<i>A shot is heard.</i>] What&rsquo;s that? [<i>All are alarmed
and look off entrance.</i>]</p>

<p class="center"><b>Enter</b> <i><span class="smcap">Adolphus</span> and <span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span>, R. 2 E.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Adol.</b> [<i>R.</i>] He&rsquo;s done it, Colonel!&mdash;he&rsquo;s done it!</p>

<p><b>Morrell.</b> Done what? Who?</p>

<p><b>Adol.</b> Ralph Murdell! He pulled a revolver and shot
himself through the head.</p>

<p><b>Cor.</b> Yes! His rash act has precipitated him into eternity&mdash;he&rsquo;s
dead!</p>

<p><b>Morrell.</b> [<i>Shrugs his shoulders.</i>] Well, he has only saved
me the stern duty of condemning him to such a fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> [<i>Aside.</i>] His act has freed Hilda from the yoke
of misery and despair. [<i>Commotion outside. Voices heard
crying</i> &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; <i>in the distance.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Morrell.</b> What means this excitement? Dollerclutch, go
and learn the cause! [<b>Exit</b> <i><span class="smcap">Dollerclutch</span>, L. 2 E.,
hastily.</i>] They are yelling hurrah! There must be
some good news from the front. They seem wild with
joy!</p>

<p class="center"><b>Re-enter</b> <i><span class="smcap">Dollerclutch</span>, L. 2 E.</i>
</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> [<i>Rushing around excitedly.</i>] Hurrah! hurrah!
hurrah!</p>

<p><b>Morrell.</b> [<i>Stopping him.</i>] Give us the news.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> Hurrah! The war is over! Lee has surrendered
to Grant!</p>

<p><b>Omnes.</b> Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! [<i>Wild excitement and
joy.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> [<i>Embracing <span class="smcap">Adrienne</span>.</i>] Then is our happiness
complete. We shall never part again.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> And I will, at last, leave my bachelorhood and
worship at the shrine of my charming Anastasia!</p>

<p><b>Anas.</b> [<i>Falls in his arms.</i>] You dear man!</p>

<p><b>Cor.</b> [<i>Aside.</i>] She throws true nobility aside [<i>pointing to
himself</i>] for such a presumptuous old fool! Oh! woman!
woman! [<i>Sighs deeply and walks aside.</i>]</p>

<p><b>Hen.</b> [<i>Leading <span class="smcap">Hilda</span> forward. To <span class="smcap">Morris</span>.</i>] If you
will allow me, let me add my joy to the already o&rsquo;erflowing
cup! Hilda has&mdash;[<i><span class="smcap">Hilda</span> pulls his coat.</i>] I beg
your pardon&mdash;Alice has promised to administer to my
future joy, with your permission!</p>

<p><b>Morris.</b> [<i>Joins their hands.</i>] Bless you, my children!</p>

<p><b>Adri.</b> [<i>To <span class="smcap">Reginald</span>.</i>] Dearest Reginald! The joy I
have found in the new born love for my noble husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
will make me never regret that it was by force of
impulse that I was led to accept your heart and hand!</p>

<p><b>Reg.</b> Let the agony of the past be buried in the joy of
the present. [<i>To audience.</i>] And if you will forgive
the impulse that led me from my post of duty, there
will not be a cloud to obscure the sunshine of our future
happiness.</p>

<p><b>Morrell.</b> The end has justified the act.</p>

<p><b>Dol.</b> I, too, have left my post of duty&mdash;but let the result
be an extenuation of my desertion.</p>

<p><b>Morrell.</b> [<i>Takes him by hand.</i>] Yes! I overlook it freely!
and I feel satisfied that He, who watches over us all, will
not censure us for being led <span class="small">BY FORCE OF IMPULSE</span>!</p>

<h3>A Few Opinions.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent Manuals.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Book Chat.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Two Pretty Little Volumes.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Cincinnati Inquirer.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Admirably suited for the purpose intended.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Albany Argus.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. <span class="smcap">Weld</span> is a well known adept in this kind of entertainment.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York
Evangelist.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;These small volumes form a complete assistant to any one desirous of giving
tableaux.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>St. Louis Republican.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;They will be helpful to young people preparing this pleasant method of
entertainment.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian Register.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will be of much practical use and value to schools and persons interested in
social amusements for church or home.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>N. Y. School Journal.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;They will be of service for private entertainments. The directions as to
dress and posing are full, and the illustrations will be very helpful.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Hartford
Courant.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;They contain all the directions which can possibly be necessary to enable a
company of amateurs to successfully present a number of tableaux of a varied

has been forgotten or left out. To persons interested in this kind of amusement,
the little books will prove invaluable.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New Orleans Picayune.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;To any one who contemplates indulging in tableaux, these little books of Mrs.
Weld&rsquo;s will be invaluable. So clearly does she explain the minutiÃ¦, that a manager
under her guidance may feel all the confidence which experience can bring.
The writer is especially explicit in showing how the effects of scenery and costume
may be secured with the simplest of material, so that the degree of expense may
be made a matter of choice.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Buffalo Express.</i></p></blockquote>
